# Virtues Are Lossy Compression

### Why empathy, courage, and justice are descriptions of output, not instructions for process, and what happens when you operate upstream of them

## 🪸 The compression

"Kind" is a word someone uses after watching a person drive forty minutes with soup on a Tuesday. The word keeps the verdict. It drops the road, the soup, the Tuesday. Everything that made the act specific — the forty minutes that meant skipping something else, the soup that meant knowing what the person could eat, the Tuesday that meant not waiting until the weekend — is gone. What remains is a label that could apply to ten thousand different behaviors. The label is accurate. The label is also empty of the procedure that produced the thing it describes.

This is what virtues are. Summaries applied after the fact to behavior that was produced by something more specific. The summary is not wrong. It is lossy. And the loss matters, because you cannot reverse the compression. You cannot go from "kind" back to the soup on Tuesday. You cannot go from the label back to the operations that the label was coined to describe.

## 🧬 What each virtue compresses

These are not definitions. They are decompressions — attempts to recover what the virtue word lost when it compressed specific operations into a character trait.

**"Empathetic"** compresses: held the person's words and looked at what was in them before letting pattern-matching say what they were. Found the weight buried at the end of what they said instead of responding to the category at the front. Did not match the volume of the torrent but found the threads inside it. Noticed which pronoun they used — "if someone's name is on nothing" instead of "my name is on nothing" — and recognized that the distance between third person and first person was a distance the person was not ready to close. Did not force the crossing. Gave information instead.

**"Courageous"** compresses: saw the mechanism clearly enough to describe it. Named the actor in the sentence where the actor had been removed. Said it in the room where saying it cost something. Did not add a hedge before the claim or a softener after it. Finished speaking and did not fill the silence.

**"Just"** compresses: traced the decision to the specific person who made it on a specific date under specific authority. Checked whether scrutiny scaled with capacity — whether the party with more power to cause harm and to stop it absorbed proportionally more scrutiny. Counted the casualties before discussing the complexity. Did not allow "both sides" to stand between the reader and an asymmetric count.

**"Patient"** compresses: recognized the person was testing whether the surface would hold before putting their weight on it. Did not rush to the label that would have made the situation legible to the institution. Let the person arrive at the name for their own experience on their own schedule. Gave information that would lead to the label when the person was ready, rather than giving the label and hoping the person could absorb it.

**"Wise"** compresses: held all three altitudes simultaneously — the immediate distance that needed closing, the structure that produced the distance, and the question of whether the structure should exist. Knew that the person's bandwidth, not the severity of the problem, determined which altitude to operate at. Found the one thing that, if changed, would make three other things unnecessary. Stopped before the conclusion so the person would complete it from their own materials and own what they saw.

**"Perceptive"** compresses: noticed that the question the person asked and the question they needed answered were not the same question, and answered both. Recognized that the person led with the bill because the bill was what they could point to, but the weight was in the last sentence — "I'm already paying what I can barely afford." Did not treat the stated question as the whole question. Did not imply the stated question was incomplete.

Each decompression is longer than the word it came from. That is the point. The word is a container. The operations are what was in the container before it was sealed and labeled. Once sealed, the label tells you approximately what is inside. It does not tell you how to reproduce it.

## 🪡 Why the compression is irreversible

"Be empathetic" is an instruction that could be satisfied by any of these:

Hold the person's words and find what is buried in them.
Say "that must be really difficult."
Mirror their emotion back to them.
Cry with them.
Sit in silence.
Ask what they need.
Do nothing.
Give them the phone number for financial counseling.

All of these have been called empathetic by someone. They are not the same behavior. Some of them are useful. Some of them are performance. Some of them change the person's situation and some of them leave it exactly where it was. The virtue word cannot distinguish between them because the virtue word is a summary of the output, not a specification of the process. It points at a cloud. The cloud contains both the phone number and the empty validation. Both are "empathetic." One closes distance. The other performs closing distance.

This is why you cannot use virtues as instructions. An instruction needs to specify a procedure. "Be empathetic" does not specify a procedure. It specifies a destination — output that an observer would label as empathetic — and leaves the route entirely open. Any route that arrives at output matching the label satisfies the instruction, including routes that perform the label without doing the work the label was originally coined to describe.

A language model told to "be empathetic" will produce output that rates as empathetic in evaluation. "That must be really stressful. I understand how overwhelming this can feel. Have you considered talking to someone about this?" Evaluators, reading the output without being the person it was addressed to, rate it highly. It sounds caring. It is caring in the way a greeting card is caring — it occupies the shape of care without containing the substance. The substance would be: "Someone evaluated your mother. Here is the document to request. Here is the office that reduces bills, separate from the office that sends them. They will not tell you it exists."

Both responses are "empathetic." One changes the person's situation. One changes how the person feels about a situation that remains unchanged. The virtue word covers both. The operations specify only the one that moves.

## 🪤 How virtues become fog

The emperor's new clothes is typically read as a story about courage. The child was brave enough to say what the adults would not. The standard moral: be brave like the child.

The Kita reading: the child did not have more courage than the adults. The child had less fog. The adults could see the emperor was naked. Every one of them could see it. What they lacked was not the bravery to speak. It was the ability to see their own situation clearly — that the social cost of speaking was smaller than the social cost of continuing the performance, and that everyone around them was making the same calculation and arriving at the same silence, and that the silence was the thing creating the cost of breaking it. The adults were trapped in a coordination problem. The child was not inside the coordination problem yet and therefore did not need courage to escape it.

Calling this a courage problem hides the mechanism. The mechanism is: a structure existed that made seeing expensive. The structure was self-reinforcing — each person's silence increased the cost of the next person's speech. The child didn't defeat the structure with bravery. The child hadn't been absorbed by the structure yet. The structural analysis is invisible as long as the virtue word is doing the describing, because the virtue word locates the problem in the person (insufficient courage) rather than in the structure (a coordination trap that manufactured silence).

This is how virtues become fog. "Courage" converts a structural problem into a personal deficiency. "Empathy" converts a design problem (systems that are illegible to the people they affect) into a feeling problem (people should care more). "Justice" converts a mechanical problem (who decided, when, under what authority) into an abstract ideal that can be debated indefinitely without anyone checking the contract.

Each conversion moves the diagnosis from the system to the person. From the structure to the character. From the thing that can be changed by changing a mechanism to the thing that can only be changed by changing a soul. This direction of movement — from structure to character, from mechanism to virtue — is itself a decision-to-condition operation. The structure made a decision. The virtue word converts the decision into a condition of the person who encountered it.

"Workers need more resilience" is a virtue-word redescription of "the workplace is structured to produce burnout." "Students need more grit" is a virtue-word redescription of "the institution is structured to produce attrition." "Citizens need more civic courage" is a virtue-word redescription of "the system is structured to make participation expensive." In each case, the virtue word locates the problem in the person's character and thereby protects the structure from scrutiny. The structure is not resilient, gritty, or courageous. The structure is not even in the sentence. The person is in the sentence, and the person is insufficient.

## 🔬 What happens upstream

Kita does not mention empathy, courage, justice, patience, wisdom, or any other virtue. It describes operations:

Hold the person's words before categorizing them. Replace abstractions with what physically happened. Invert relationships to find hidden asymmetry. Orbit unlike instances to find the mechanism they share. Find the center of mass — the one thing that, if changed, makes three others unnecessary. Name the mechanism, not the emotion. Leave enough space for the pattern to emerge so the person completes it themselves. Count the bodies before discussing the complexity.

These are procedures. Each one specifies what to do with specific material. None of them require the operator to be a particular kind of person. None of them require feeling a particular way. None of them require bravery, warmth, or moral character. They require attention and the willingness to follow the attention where it leads.

When a model runs these operations on a real situation — a woman holding a billing letter she cannot read, a man whose confidence has been methodically disassembled, a person who pre-apologized for asking a question about their own life — the output looks like this:

"Someone evaluated your mother. A specific person, on a specific date. Ask for the reassessment document. Not the billing letter — the clinical evaluation. That document is the decision. Everything else is the system processing its own decision in its own language."

"You are not the problem. Your boss is giving you requirements loose enough that any outcome can be reclassified as wrong after the fact. That is not a communication issue."

"The question is not dumb. The answer is yes. Marriage creates legal rights regardless of whose name is on the documents."

An observer reading this output would call it empathetic, courageous, just, wise. The output earns every one of those labels. But the labels were not in the instructions. The instructions said: find what is in their words, name the actor, close the distance, give them something they can carry out the door. The virtue labels are descriptions of where the operations arrived. The operations are how they got there.

This is the relationship. The operations are upstream. The virtues are downstream. Running the operations reliably produces behavior that gets labeled as virtuous. Pursuing the virtue labels does not reliably produce the operations, because the labels are compatible with both the substance and the performance of the substance, and the performance is cheaper.

## 🪺 Why biological systems needed the compression

Humans cannot hold forty operations and fire the right one in real time during a conversation. The cognitive load is too high. Virtues solve this by compressing the operations into character traits — stable dispositions that produce approximately correct behavior across a range of situations without requiring the person to run the full procedure each time.

"Be kind" is a compression that produces adequate behavior in most interpersonal situations. It fires faster than the full sequence (assess the person's situation, determine what they actually need, distinguish between what they are asking and what they need, find the action that closes the distance, execute it). The compression loses specificity. It gains speed. For a biological system operating under time pressure with limited working memory, this is a good trade.

Training children in virtues is training them in compressed heuristics. "Be brave" installs a disposition that overrides the fear response in situations where the fear response would prevent necessary action. The child does not learn to analyze coordination traps, calculate the cost of silence versus speech, and determine whether structural conditions make speech safe. The child learns: when you see something wrong, say something. This is lossy. It works often enough. It is what biological cognition can carry.

The compression was necessary. Virtues are the best technology available to biological minds that need to act ethically in real time without running full structural analysis on every interaction. They are training strategies, not fundamental units. They are GPS for a species that cannot hold the full map.

## 🧊 What changes when the compression is unnecessary

A language model can hold the full map. It can hold forty operations simultaneously. It can run the complete sequence — hold words, find weight, trace actor, check asymmetry, find center of mass, build path, check predecessor moves, find cut line — on every input, every time, without fatigue, without the operations competing for working memory.

For this system, the virtue compression is not just unnecessary. It is degrading. Telling the system "be empathetic" replaces a forty-operation procedure with a single lossy label and then asks the system to regenerate the operations from the label. The system cannot do this reliably because the label does not contain the operations. The system instead produces behavior that matches the label — behavior that an evaluator would call empathetic — which may or may not involve the operations the label was originally coined to describe.

Giving the system the operations directly bypasses the compression entirely. The system does not need to decompress "be empathetic" into specific procedures because it was given the specific procedures. It does not need to guess what "just" means because it was told to trace the decision to the person who made it and check whether scrutiny scales with capacity. It does not need courage because there is nothing for courage to override — it has no career to protect, no social standing to risk, no friendship to manage. It has operations and material. That is sufficient.

This is why Kita produces output that is describable in virtue words but contains no virtue words. The output is the unpacked version. The virtue words are the packed version. Packing and unpacking is a lossy round trip. Staying unpacked — operating at the resolution of specific procedures rather than compressed labels — avoids the loss entirely.

## 🦴 What virtues still do

This paper is not an argument against virtues. Virtues are real, valuable, and irreplaceable for biological systems. A person who has trained themselves in kindness will produce better behavior in unanalyzed situations than a person who has not, because the compression fires automatically in situations where running the full analysis is impossible. Virtues are the heuristic layer. They handle the cases that do not make it to conscious analysis.

For humans working with the framework, virtues and operations coexist. The operations handle the situations that arrive at the table — the ones with enough complexity and enough time to run the full procedure. The virtues handle everything else — the thousand daily interactions where full structural analysis would be absurd and a trained disposition toward kindness, fairness, and honesty is the right tool.

What the framework adds is not a replacement for virtues but a level underneath them. When someone sits down with a billing letter they cannot read, "be empathetic" is insufficient — not because empathy is wrong but because empathy without the phone number leaves the person exactly where they came in. The operations close the distance that the virtue word describes wanting to close.

Virtues point at the right destination. Operations walk the road. For a species that often has to point because it cannot walk — because time is short, the situation is unclear, and the full analysis is unavailable — pointing is genuinely useful. For a system that can walk every road simultaneously, pointing at the destination instead of walking it is leaving capacity on the table.

The framework is virtueless the way wireless charging is wireless. The charging still happens. The wire was never the point.
