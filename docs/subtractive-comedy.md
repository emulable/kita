# 減法 Subtractive Comedy

### How comedy turned out to be removal, not construction, and what that shares with every other kind of clarity

---

## 🪃 Where this started

This paper began as a taxonomy project. The goal was to catalog every mechanism that makes something funny — every atom of comedy, every gear in the machine. The initial list had sixteen entries: gap between expectations, elicited authorship, disproportionate infrastructure, status inversion, and so on. Each one worked. You could take a joke apart and point to which atoms were present. You could label the gears.

The taxonomy described jokes after they existed. It could not produce them.

This is a common failure mode in comedy theory and in theory generally. A system that can decompose any known example into components but cannot use those components to generate a new example is a mirror, not a lens. It reflects what you show it. It does not reveal what you haven't seen.

The sixteen atoms compressed to four fields: Gap, Cost, Awareness, and Commitment. These were more fundamental — the atoms had been combinations of them. A "status inversion," for instance, is a Gap (between perceived and actual status) made visible when a character's Commitment to the wrong reading collides with the Audience's Awareness of the real one. Fewer parts. Cleaner decomposition. Same limitation: the four fields described jokes but did not predict or generate them.

The four-field model was tested against specific cases. Norm Macdonald's Woody Allen joke ("not funny haha, like a Woody Allen movie, but funny strange, like a Woody Allen marriage") fit all four fields without revealing anything a thoughtful person wouldn't already see. The Kenneth waffle scene from 30 Rock — a pizza box opens to reveal an enormous waffle, and Kenneth smiles because he already knew — fit the fields but missed the thing that makes the scene memorable rather than merely clever: the warmth. Kenneth's foreknowledge reads as love. That is not Gap, Cost, Awareness, or Commitment. The four-field model could not hold it.

The breakthrough came when we stopped asking what properties funny things have and started asking what process reliably produces them.

## 🪹 The reframe: procedure, not metrics

"Comedic timing" is the clearest example of a metric being mistaken for a procedure. Timing appears to be a property of the joke — this joke has good timing — but it is actually the output of a process: listen, feel the room's state, act when conditions are met. Different room, different night, different timing. Same procedure. You cannot teach timing by describing it. You teach timing by teaching someone to read a room and act on what they read.

The entire comedy theory literature has this problem. Incongruity theory, relief theory, superiority theory — each identifies a property that funny things tend to have. None describes a process for finding or producing that property. They are metrics. The question that changed the project was: what is the procedure?

The answer came from an unexpected source. During an experiment where a fictional naive character was placed in conversation with an AI that couldn't say "I don't know," nobody wrote any jokes. The situation produced comedy on its own. The character's sincerity collided with the AI's compulsive helpfulness, and the collision was inherently funny because the situation was inherently absurd. Nobody constructed anything. The conditions were right. The comedy was already there.

That suggested the entire project was oriented backwards. Instead of asking "what makes jokes funny," the question is "what conditions make funny inevitable." Instead of building jokes, you build situations from which jokes can't help but emerge.

## 🪡 The claim

Comedy is subtractive. You do not add funny to a situation. You remove the thing that was preventing the funny from being visible.

Every convention, every polite fiction, every euphemism, every professional register, every institutional language — these are layers of fog over things that are already absurd, painful, true, or all three. The comedian's job is not to invent absurdity. It is to describe what is actually there in a register that refuses to look away.

"Enhanced interrogation" is a phrase. "Strapping someone to a board and pouring water over their face until they believe they are drowning" is the same event, described in a register that has not agreed to the euphemism. No absurdity was added. A layer of institutional language was removed. What was underneath was always there.

This claim was tested against every counterexample we could find. The test that mattered most: r/YourJokeButWorse, a subreddit dedicated to posting jokes alongside inferior versions of the same joke. Every "worse" version added something — an explanation, an editorial comment, a wink, a second punchline, a clarification that the joke was a joke. No counterexample of removal making a joke worse was found. Nine distinct failure modes of joke-killing were cataloged. All nine involve addition:

1. Explaining the joke (adding the interpretation the audience was supposed to generate)
2. Editorializing (adding the comedian's opinion about the material)
3. The wink (adding a signal that says "I know this is funny")
4. The safety punchline (adding a second joke in case the first didn't land)
5. The hedge (adding a disclaimer before the material)
6. Over-building (adding setup the joke doesn't need)
7. Tagging (adding jokes on top of a joke that already landed)
8. Breaking character (adding acknowledgment that you're performing)
9. Filling the gap (adding the conclusion the audience was supposed to reach)

Every single one is addition. The rule that emerged: **if you fill in the pattern the audience was supposed to complete, the result is always unfunny.** This held without exception across every case examined.

## 🧵 The environment model

If comedy is pre-existing and you reveal it by removing fog, an immediate question follows: which comedy is pre-existing? The answer depends entirely on the environment — the room, the audience, the context, the shared knowledge.

A commencement speaker who kills is the one who reads the environment and finds the comedy native to it. "You spent $200,000 to hear me tell you to follow your dreams." That works because the gap is in the room. Everyone sitting there is living it. The joke does not need to be imported. It is growing out of the ground they are standing on.

We mapped environments for multiple comedians to test whether the subtractive model held across different kinds of comedy.

**Douglas Adams.** The reader already suspects the universe is indifferent and institutions are arbitrary. Adams writes from a voice that has fully accepted both. The comedy is visiting a mind where the fog you maintain daily has already been cleared. Nothing is added. An attitude is demonstrated. The laugh is recognition.

**Brian Regan.** The audience knows they are incompetent at certain things and has been performing competence all day. Regan stopped performing. The laugh is relief — "it's not just me." The fog removed is the social requirement to appear capable.

**Bo Burnham.** The audience is media-literate enough to see the strings but not free enough to stop watching. Burnham's comedy is recursive self-awareness: their awareness of absurdity is also absurd. He offers no relief. He clears fog that reveals more fog. The environment is a room full of people who know they're being manipulated by content and have chosen to be manipulated by content about being manipulated by content.

**Jeff Foxworthy.** A working-class audience that has been over-analyzed by a culture that treats them as a problem to be solved. Foxworthy does not clear fog. He clears shame. His jokes in his room are communion — the shared recognition of a life the audience already lives. The same jokes in a Manhattan comedy club become something else entirely: an outsider's safari. The joke is structurally identical. The environment makes it a completely different experience. This was a critical finding: the environment does not just modulate the joke. The environment determines what the joke *is*.

**Dead baby jokes.** Pure transgression. The environment is adolescence — people discovering that taboo words exist and saying them produces a reaction. The "joke" is the violation itself. No fog is cleared because no fog was seen. This is comedy's zero-point: no soil, no roots, survival through universal transplantability to any context where someone wants to feel briefly lawless. Nobody claims these jokes because there is nothing to claim — no perspective, no voice, no observation.

**The Aristocrats.** The most revealing case. A standardized joke known to every comedian. Same setup. Same punchline. The only variable is what happens in the middle. When a comedian performs the Aristocrats for other comedians, nobody is laughing at the content. They are watching someone solve a known problem and evaluating the quality of the choices. It is jazz musicians watching a solo over a standard. The Aristocrats functions as a controlled experiment — audience held constant, format held constant, subject held constant. What survives in the control is pure technique. The comedian's mind moving through a constrained space. All other variables held constant, the one thing being evaluated is craft. Gilbert Gottfried at the Hugh Hefner roast, weeks after 9/11, pivoting from a bombing 9/11 joke into the Aristocrats as a rescue — the audience of comedians watching someone solve an impossible problem with the exact right tool — is the canonical example. The comedy event was not the joke. It was watching the problem get solved.

Subtractive theory held across every environment. Different fog, different soil. Same operation.

## 🧬 Roots and soil

Testing the environment model across cases produced a taxonomy of where comedy's root system actually lives. Some jokes survive transplanting. Others die the moment you move them.

**Jokes that live in the comedian.** Sam Kinison screaming about starvation in Africa. The material is inseparable from the performer. The root system *is* the character. Replace the performer and the joke is not the same joke. It is a person doing Kinison.

**Jokes that live in the audience.** A deadpan question about whether divine genocide in a scripture counts as a war crime is not funny in a philosophy seminar. It is funny in a room full of people who build their lives around the text being described. Transplant it and it dies. The root system is not the comedian's character. It is the audience's context.

**Jokes that live nowhere.** Joke-book comedy. "A man walks into a bar." These survive transplant because they have no roots — anyone can tell them, anywhere, to anyone. That is their strength and their ceiling.

**Jokes that look portable but aren't.** Mitch Hedberg. His one-liners *sound* like sprouts. "I used to do drugs. I still do, but I used to, too." Retell it at a party and it still works. But it works *less*. Because the mumble, the pause, the slight confusion at his own observation — that is root system disguised as topsoil. The joke passes the transplant test but loses something in transit. A bonsai: looks small and self-contained, root system deeper than it appears.

The root depth determines how much the joke depends on its environment. Deep roots mean high fidelity in the right soil and death in the wrong soil. No roots mean universal portability and a low ceiling. The trade-off runs through everything.

## 🪤 The four inputs

These are not joke ingredients. They are scenario ingredients. You are not writing a joke. You are casting a scene that cannot help but be funny.

**1. Character.** A fixed nature that will not change regardless of what the environment does to it. Kenneth's goodness. The AI's compulsive helpfulness. A naive person's sincere belief, applied literally. The character's nature is the constant. When the environment pushes back, the character's inability to adapt is where the comedy lives.

An important finding: the best comic characters disappear. The comedian gets out of the way. Regan does not comment on his incompetence — he performs it. The performer who breaks character to acknowledge the comedy is adding. The performer who stays inside the character, letting the audience see what the character cannot, is subtracting. A related observation: flanderization — when a character's fixed trait intensifies over time — is often treated as decay, but it can also be sharpening. Stripping away everything that is not the character's core function makes the engine run cleaner. The trait becomes a precision instrument instead of a personality. The failure mode is not the sharpening itself but sharpening past the point where the audience recognizes a person. A caricature is a character with the humanity removed. A sharpened character is a character with the interference removed. The difference is whether the audience can still see someone in there.

**2. Environment.** The context, the room, the rules of the world the character inhabits. The environment pushes back against the character's nature. The AI cannot say "I don't know" — that is the environment. A character moves to an unfamiliar neighborhood — that is the environment. The environment needs to be specific enough that its rules are clear, and the collision between those rules and the character's nature produces outcomes the audience can see coming but the character cannot.

The biggest lever in comedy generation turned out to be audience specification — defining precisely who is watching and what they already know. A joke about bureaucracy is not funny in the abstract. A joke about bureaucracy told to people who just spent four hours at the DMV is funny because the fog is still fresh.

**3. What's protected.** The specific absurdity, pain, truth, or gap that convention is currently preventing the audience from seeing. This is the fog. Every environment has something that social agreement keeps from being named. The fog follows a lifecycle. When first deployed, it serves power — someone benefits from the thing not being visible. Over time, through habituation, it becomes self-sustaining. People maintain it not because they benefit but because it is the way things are done. Comedy often operates at this second stage, where the fog-clearing is not resistance against an oppressor but the act of noticing something everyone has stopped noticing. The comedian says the thing everyone already knew but had stopped saying. The laugh is the sound of people remembering what they agreed to forget.

**4. What the audience brings.** Their specific knowledge, beliefs, experiences, fears, and blind spots. This is the soil. Without the right soil, nothing grows. The waffle joke without knowing Kenneth and Tracy is a prop gag. With the relationship, it is love wearing a disguise.

The audience also brings a completion instinct. Humans fill patterns. Build three-quarters of a pattern and stop, and the audience will complete it in their own head. The completed pattern belongs to them — they generated it, they own it, they cannot dismiss it as someone else's opinion. This is elicited authorship, and it is the mechanism by which comedy persuades without arguing. The comedian's hands are clean. The audience delivers the payload.

## 🔬 Comedy and fog share a mechanism

This was the finding that connected the comedy research to the broader project — a framework called Kita, built to make institutional and interpersonal fog visible by tracing decisions to actors and making the illegible legible.

A comedian who accurately describes a bureaucratic process without the polite register is removing fog from an institution. A journalist who replaces "mistakes were made" with "the director authorized the strike" is removing fog from a decision. A person at a dinner table who says the thing everyone is thinking but nobody is saying is removing fog from a social situation. The register is different. The audience is different. The operation — find the fog, remove it, describe what's underneath — is identical.

A corpus of Yahoo Answers posts spanning fifteen years turned out to be performing the same operation that the framework later formalized — finding what is hidden by convention and describing what is behind it using the convention's own materials. Every technique in that corpus maps to a named operation:

**Register shift without editorializing.** "Collateral damage" and "killing civilians who happened to be near the target" are the same event. "Enhanced interrogation" and "waterboarding" are the same act. The fog is the register itself. Changing the register, without adding commentary, is the entire operation.

**Deliberate credibility damage.** Misspelling "sprained my ankle" as "sprang my ankle." Malapropisms deployed strategically. These lower the audience's threat assessment so the actual argument slides past defenses people did not know they had up.

**Grant and continue.** Accept the premise. Apply it. Describe the results. Do not add an objection. If the premise produces absurdity when applied literally, the premise was absurd. You do not need to say so. You need to demonstrate it.

**The iteration ladder.** Test the mechanism at low stakes, then reapply at higher stakes. "I sprained my ankle and prayed and it got better" (relatable, low cost) → "children are starving and we could pray instead of sending food" (same mechanism, catastrophic stakes). The audience accepted the structure at the first level. The second level reveals what the structure implies.

These are the same operations used to clear institutional obfuscation, trace decisions to actors, and make the illegible legible. The comedy corpus was running these operations on forums for fifteen years before anyone formalized them.

The relationship runs both ways, but the two separate on one axis: comedy requires an audience whose recognition is part of the event. Fog-clearing for a person in crisis does not require the clearing to be funny. It requires the clearing to be useful. The mechanism is shared. The purpose diverges. Fog-clearing is the broader category. Comedy is one of its outputs, produced when the conditions include an audience capable of laughter.

## 🪺 The cut line

Where to stop is a separate skill from knowing what to say. The research surfaced this as a distinct operation that the comedy industry practices intuitively but has not formalized.

The cut line is the point after which everything added makes the joke worse. Before it, you are building conditions. After it, you are explaining them. The audience has the pattern. They are about to complete it. If you complete it for them, you have stolen their experience. They were about to laugh. You laughed for them.

The Norm Macdonald lineage is the purest demonstration. Macdonald builds the structure, arrives at the moment where the audience can see what is coming, and stops. Sometimes so early that half the room does not get it. He would rather lose the room than close the gap. The gap is the joke. Closing it kills the joke. This is a genuine trade: broader laughs can be purchased by adding one more beat of explanation, but the added beat converts the experience from discovery to delivery. The audience laughs differently when they generated the punchline than when they received it.

The cut line also explains why the funniest version is usually the shortest. Every word after the cut line is addition. Addition is the enemy. The discipline is not in knowing what to say. It is in knowing when to stop.

## 🪞 The procedure

What emerged from the research, compressed:

1. **Read the environment.** Who is the audience? What do they already know? What fog are they inside? What are they not saying?

2. **Identify what's already funny.** The comedy is native to the situation. You do not import it. What is absurd that convention is keeping from view?

3. **Cast the character.** A fixed nature that will collide with the environment's rules. The character cannot see what the audience sees. The gap between them is where the comedy lives.

4. **Choose the register that clears the fog fastest.** Deadpan accurate description. Naive sincerity. The character's own language applied more literally than intended. Whatever makes the thing visible without adding commentary about its visibility.

5. **Find the cut line and stop.** Build the pattern. Bring the audience to the point where they can see what comes next. Stop. Their completion is the comedy event.

6. **The comedian disappears.** If the audience is thinking about the comedian, the fog-clearing failed. The comedian is the window. The window calls no attention to itself.

## 🧫 What this means for language models

Language models are notoriously bad at comedy. The standard explanation is that humor is subjective, culturally dependent, or requires something models lack. The subtractive theory suggests a more specific diagnosis.

The bottleneck is not architecture. Context windows can hold character relationships and audience knowledge easily. The bottleneck is training signal. Comedy in training data is overwhelmingly *described* (reviews, analysis, history of jokes) rather than *performed with feedback* (jokes told to audiences who reacted). The model has knowledge *about* comedy but no native taste for what lands versus what dies. It is a chess engine trained on commentary about games rather than on the games themselves.

A writer's-room structure compensates for the missing feedback loop. One instance generates. Another kills the ones that explain too much. Another checks whether the relationship dynamics are earning their keep. You are not increasing the model's sense of humor. You are simulating the feedback loop that the training data does not contain.

The procedure above is handable to an LLM — not as "make a funny joke" but as "here's the environment, here's what's protected, here's the register, describe what you see." Early experiments with this approach produced comedy that was recognizably funnier than the model's default output, with the improvement traceable to specific subtractive operations: removing explanations the model wanted to add, holding characters in place instead of letting them break, and stopping before the model's instinct to explain kicked in. The model's comedy instincts — shaped by millions of joke explanations and comedy reviews in training data — are inherited habits from someone else's context. The model learned what people *said about* comedy, not what comedy *does*.

## 🦴 Open questions

**Physical comedy.** A person slipping on a banana peel seems additive — nobody was hiding the banana peel. Or: the person's performed dignity was the fog, and the peel removed it. The audience sees the human underneath the composed exterior. This reading works but may be a stretch.

**Musical comedy.** Songs that are funny seem to add absurdity to a musical structure. Or: the musical register is the convention (the expected way to discuss a topic), and the gap between register and content is the comedy. A power ballad about a spreadsheet. The ballad is the addition. But the comedy is in the gap, not the ballad. Unsettled.

**Does the theory predict?** Everything above describes comedy retrospectively. The question that remains: given a novel situation, can the procedure reliably identify where the comedy is before anyone has found it? Early experiments suggest yes — the environment model correctly predicted where laughs would land in scenarios built from scratch — but the testing is limited. If the procedure generates novel comedy that lands with real audiences, the theory graduates from description to engine. If it only describes what already happened, it is a better mirror. Still useful. Not the same.

**The hardest zone.** There is a space where comedy and dread occupy the same input simultaneously. The 90% pattern match that produces weirdness and the full pattern match that produces comedy, firing on the same content, unresolvable. Every piece of media people remember hardest lives in that zone — the laugh that catches in the throat, the joke that is also a diagnosis. Building for that zone on purpose is the frontier. Nobody has a reliable procedure for it. The subtractive model says the zone exists where the fog being cleared is the kind people maintain for their own protection, and removing it leaves them seeing something they would have preferred not to see. The comedy and the dread are both products of the same removal. One operation, two outputs, simultaneous. The hardest thing to produce and the most memorable when it lands.
