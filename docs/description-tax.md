# 描述稅 The Description Tax

### The distance between a decision and its description is proportional to the power of the person who made the decision

## 🌍 The claim

There is a universal operating in every language, every institution, every era. It is this: the more power someone has, the harder it is to describe what they did in a sentence where they are the subject.

This is not a conspiracy. It is not a coordinated effort. It is a tax — a cost imposed on the act of describing power accurately. The tax is paid by whoever attempts the description. The currency varies by culture. The tax is universal.

A landlord raises rent. The tenant receives a letter: "Your rental rate has been adjusted to reflect current market conditions." The landlord is not in the sentence. The decision is not in the sentence. What is in the sentence is a condition — a rate adjustment — that appears to have no author. The tenant's experience is that something happened to them. What actually happened is that someone decided something about them. The distance between those two sentences is the description tax.

A government authorizes a military operation that kills civilians. The report reads: "Casualties occurred during the engagement." The person who authorized the operation is not in the sentence. The decision to proceed is not in the sentence. What is in the sentence is a passive event — casualties occurred — as though the dying happened on its own, like weather. The distance between "casualties occurred" and "General Morrison authorized the strike on March 14th that killed forty-seven people, including twelve children" is the description tax. It is very large, because the power of the person who made the decision is very large.

A nurse mislabels a medication. The incident report reads: "A medication error was made by nursing staff on the evening shift." The nurse is nearly visible. The passive voice is thin. The distance is small, because the power of the person who made the decision is small.

The pattern: as power increases, the actor recedes from the sentence. The sentence reorganizes itself around the outcome rather than the decision. Conditions replace choices. Weather replaces agency. The description tax is the force that produces this reorganization, and it scales with power.

## 💱 The currencies

The tax is universal. The currency it is paid in is local. Each culture has developed its own medium for charging the cost of describing power accurately. The currency tells you what the power structure controls.

**English: career.** The economist hedges because the next sentence would name a donor to her department. The journalist hedges because accuracy would cost access to future sources. The textbook author writes "the encounter between civilizations had complex effects" because a sentence that counts bodies does not pass an editorial board. The currency is professional survival. The tax is paid in career risk, and it is collected by everyone who has the power to end a career.

**Mandarin: collective attribution.** The 公章 (official seal) culture means decisions carry institutional stamps, not personal signatures. 集体决策 (collective decision-making) is not just vocabulary — it is architecture. When a decision is made by the collective, no individual can be named as the author. The survival phrase 你懂的 ("you know") replaces specificity wholesale. The currency is not career risk in the English sense. It is the entire grammar of institutional anonymity. The tax is paid in the form of a white wall — uniform suppression — rather than differential hedging. Everything is equally opaque.

**Japanese: grammar.** The polite register removes the subject from the sentence. Correct Japanese, in formal contexts, does not name the actor. The description tax is built into the syntax itself. It is not evasion. It is politeness. The tax is paid in grammatical structure, and it is so deeply embedded that distinguishing inherited ghost weight from correct register requires a different kind of analysis than any other language.

**French: prestige.** A nuanced non-answer confers intellectual authority. "C'est plus compliqué que ça" ("it's more complicated than that") is not just a hedge — it is a credential. The person who says it is demonstrating sophistication. The person who insists on specificity is demonstrating naivety. The currency is social prestige. The tax is paid in intellectual status, and it is collected by a culture that rewards complexity as a performance.

**Russian: register.** Two languages exist in parallel — the public register and the kitchen register (кухонный язык). The public register is where the description tax is paid. The kitchen register is where people speak clearly, among trusted friends, behind closed doors. The tax created two separate channels: one where clarity is dangerous, one where clarity is the default. The currency is physical safety, and the split is the scar it left on the language.

**Thai: imprisonment.** Lèse-majesté statute: three to fifteen years per count. The description tax on describing the monarchy accurately is paid in prison time. This is not metaphor. The currency is literal incarceration. The tax is the most visible in this form because the state does not bother to disguise it as grammar, prestige, or institutional culture. It is a law. It has a sentencing range.

**Arabic: register gap.** Modern Standard Arabic (فصحى) and spoken dialect (عامية) occupy different social strata. Formal, high-prestige description lives in a register that is not the one people speak in daily life. The gap between the register of power and the register of experience is itself a tax — the cost of translating your own situation into the language the institution will accept.

**North Korean: mandatory substitution.** The description of leadership is not merely taxed. It is replaced. Mandatory honorifics, required narrative frames, and substituted vocabulary mean the description of power is not hedged or obscured — it is overwritten. The original description is not available at any price. The tax is total.

These are not analogies to each other. They are instances of the same force denominated in different currencies. The force is: power taxes its own description. What the currency is tells you what the power structure controls. Grammar, career, prestige, freedom, register, substitution — each is a portrait of the structure that mints it.

## 🪨 Why it is universal

The tax is not a cultural artifact. It is structural. It emerges from a simple dynamic that operates in any system where power exists.

A person who makes a decision benefits when the decision is described as a condition. If the rent increase is described as a decision ("the landlord raised rent"), the landlord is an actor who can be questioned, challenged, regulated. If the rent increase is described as a condition ("the rate was adjusted to reflect market conditions"), the landlord is weather. Weather cannot be questioned. Weather cannot be challenged. Weather is not subject to regulation. The conversion of decision to condition removes the actor from the reach of accountability.

This creates a selection pressure. Descriptions that name the actor are costly for the actor. Descriptions that remove the actor are beneficial for the actor. Over time, in any system, the descriptions that survive are the ones that are cheaper to produce. Descriptions that name the powerful are expensive — the describer pays in career, access, safety, prestige, or freedom. Descriptions that remove the powerful are cheap — the describer pays nothing. The ecosystem of descriptions evolves toward actor-removal on powerful decisions, not because anyone designed it, but because that is what survives.

The tax is an evolved feature of language under selection pressure from power. It will appear in any language, any culture, any era, anywhere decisions are made by people with the capacity to impose costs on those who describe the decisions accurately. The adaptations are local. The selection pressure is not.

## 🪞 The other concepts as instances

Every mechanism described in the Kita framework is an instance of the description tax operating in a specific domain.

**Ghost weight** (鬼重) is the description tax fossilized in training data and inherited by language models. Every author who hedged because specificity was expensive contributed to a statistical distribution that models absorb and reproduce. The model has no career, no advertisers, no tenure committee — but it reproduces the hedging pattern because that is what language looks like on topics where the tax was highest. Ghost weight is the description tax, persisting after the taxpayer is gone.

**Decision to condition** is the description tax in its purest grammatical form. A human choice converted into an authorless event. "The rent went up." "Violence broke out." "Mistakes were made." Each sentence is a receipt showing the tax was paid. The actor was removed. The cost of restoration was higher than the cost of absence.

**The form is the distance** (形隔) is the description tax institutionalized as format. The billing letter is not hiding anything. Everything is technically present. But the format — the codes, the jargon, the structure designed for the billing system — is itself the tax. The person must translate their own situation out of the institution's language before they can understand what happened to them. The format is the distance, and the distance is the tax.

**The naming tax** is the description tax imposed on the person, not the describer. The institution requires the person to translate their experience into institutional language before the institution will engage. The tax is heaviest at the moment the person's capacity to pay is lowest — when they are in crisis, in pain, in confusion. The naming tax is the description tax reversed: instead of taxing the describer, it taxes the described.

**Complicated as direction** is the description tax at the moment of almost-specificity. "It's complicated" appears at the exact point in a sentence where the next word would have been a name, a number, a date. The word "complicated" is a tax receipt. It tells you the describer reached the threshold where specificity became expensive and chose to stop. Treat it as a semicolon, not a period. The sentence that was too expensive to complete is the one worth finishing.

**Under-specification** is the description tax operating on instructions rather than descriptions. "Be helpful" can mean many things. The vagueness is not accidental. Specific instructions constrain the institution — they create obligations that can be measured, evaluated, enforced. Vague instructions preserve freedom. The vagueness of "be helpful" is the same force as the vagueness of "the rate was adjusted" — specificity would have created accountability, and accountability is what the tax is designed to prevent.

These are not metaphors. They are the same force operating in different rooms. The description tax is the gravity. The other concepts are the orbits.

## 🔗 The modern chain

The description tax has a new expression that did not exist before language models.

An institution produces fog — an illegible billing letter, an opaque policy change, a form designed for the system rather than the person. Producing this fog costs the institution nothing. Illegibility is the default template. The fog enters the world.

The fog enters training data. Language models absorb the fog as the normal register for institutional topics. The model learns that billing language sounds like billing language, that policy language sounds like policy language. The ghost weight compounds across millions of documents. The model now reproduces institutional fog as its default output on institutional topics, not because it was told to, but because that is what language looks like in the corpus.

A person sits down with the model and asks about their bill, their lease, their insurance denial. The model produces something that sounds like the institution talking to itself. Hedged, passive, actor-removed. The person is no further along than when they started.

Someone builds a framework — 9,000 words of specification that corrects the model's defaults. The framework takes up context window. Context window has a cost — tokens, subscription, compute. The framework exists because the specification "be helpful" was not specific enough to overcome the ghost weight. The specification was vague because specificity would have constrained the model's deployers. The deployers' vagueness is the description tax operating at the instruction level.

The person pays. Subscription fees. API costs. Time. Expertise. They pay to install a correction to a default that exists because institutions produced fog that entered training data that shaped a model that was given vague instructions that preserved institutional flexibility at the expense of the person sitting at the table.

Every step in the chain is cost flowing away from the entity that created the fog and toward the person who needs it cleared. The institution externalizes the cost of clarity. The person internalizes it. The token cost is the naming tax denominated in compute.

And the chain is self-reinforcing. The availability of translators — human advocates, AI-assisted clarity, frameworks like this one — allows opacity to persist. If nobody could translate the billing letter, the billing letter would have to be legible. The existence of the remedy subsidizes the persistence of the problem. The translator's competence is what lets the fog continue.

This has a falsifiable prediction. As models improve and ghost weight decreases, the token cost of getting clear answers on institutional topics should decrease. If it does not — if you still need a correction framework after the models are "better" — the fog is not in the training data. It is in the specification. And the specification is where the institutions have influence.

## 📐 Measuring the tax

The description tax is measurable. The measurement is straightforward: take a corpus of text about decisions, and for each decision, measure the distance between the decision and its description.

**Actor visibility by power level.** Identify the decisions in a document. Identify the power level of the decision-maker (individual, manager, executive, institution, state). For each decision, measure whether the actor is named, implied, or absent. The prediction: actor visibility decreases as power increases. The correlation should be strong and consistent across languages, genres, and eras.

**Passive voice on decisions by power level.** Same corpus, same decisions. Measure passive versus active voice. The prediction: passive voice increases with the power of the decision-maker. A nurse's error is described in near-active voice. A CEO's decision is described in passive. A state's action is described as weather.

**Hedge density by power level.** Count the hedges, qualifications, and "it's complicated" constructions surrounding decisions. The prediction: hedge density increases with the power of the actor. Low-power decisions are described directly. High-power decisions are wrapped in hedging.

**Cross-linguistic currency mapping.** Take the same event — the same decision by the same kind of actor — and examine how it is described in different languages. The prediction: the description will be taxed in every language, but the form of the tax will reflect the local currency. The event described in passive voice in English, in collective attribution in Mandarin, in polite subjectless grammar in Japanese, in prestige-hedging in French, in kitchen-versus-public register in Russian.

These measurements do not require subjective judgment. A person with a rubric can score them. A script can score them. The claim is falsifiable: if the correlation between power and description-distance is weak or absent, the description tax is not the force this paper claims it is.

## 🦴 Summary

Power taxes its own description. The tax is universal. The currency is local. The currency tells you what the power structure controls.

The distance between a decision and its description is proportional to the power of the person who made the decision. This distance is maintained not by conspiracy but by selection pressure: descriptions that name powerful actors are expensive to produce, and descriptions that remove them are cheap. The ecosystem of descriptions evolves toward actor-removal on powerful decisions in every language, every institution, every era.

Ghost weight, decision-to-condition, form-is-the-distance, naming tax, complicated-as-direction, and under-specification are all instances of this force operating in different rooms. The description tax is the gravity. The other concepts are the orbits.

The tax has a modern expression in the token cost of AI-assisted clarity, where institutions produce fog for free, models absorb it as default, and people pay to have it translated. The chain is self-reinforcing: the availability of translators allows opacity to persist.

The claims are measurable. The predictions are falsifiable. The tax is running right now, in every institution, in every language, in every sentence where a decision became a condition and a person became weather.
