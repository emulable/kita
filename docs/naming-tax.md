# The Naming Tax

### Why the people who need help the most have to work the hardest to ask for it

## 🪤 The toll booth nobody sees

You fall and break your hip. You are seventy-three years old. Your daughter drives two hours to be with you. She sits in a room with machines and fluorescent light and a stack of paper that describes what happened to you.

She cannot read it.

Not because the words are hidden. Not because the paper is locked away. Every piece of information she needs is right there in her hands. The diagnosis. The procedure code. The coverage determination. The appeals deadline. It is all technically present, technically accessible, technically transparent.

She cannot connect any of it to the thing that happened to her mother, which is that her mother fell in the kitchen and now cannot walk.

Between her mother's broken hip and the system that is supposed to help, there is a toll booth. The toll is not money. The toll is translation. Before the system will acknowledge what happened, her daughter must redescribe it in the system's language. She must convert "my mom fell and broke her hip" into a procedure code, a coverage category, a level-of-care classification, an appeals basis. She must take a thing she witnessed with her own eyes and reformat it until the institution recognizes it.

This is the naming tax. The cost imposed on a person who must translate their own experience into institutional language before the institution will engage with it. The tax is denominated in time, knowledge, and emotional capacity. It is due at the moment when the person has the least of all three.

## 🧬 The mechanism

Every institution develops its own language. This is not inherently malicious. Hospitals need procedure codes because procedures need to be tracked. Courts need legal terminology because legal distinctions need precision. Insurance companies need coverage classifications because coverage has boundaries.

The naming tax is not the existence of institutional language. It is the requirement that the person seeking help must speak it.

The mechanism has three parts.

**The person experiences something in their own language.** "My boss keeps changing what she wants and I think I'm going to get fired." "My rent went up and I can't afford it." "My husband's name is on everything and mine is on nothing." These descriptions are accurate, complete, and fully legible to any human listener.

**The institution requires a different description.** The employment issue must become a constructive dismissal claim or an FMLA application or a hostile work environment complaint. The rent increase must become a lease violation challenge or a notification-period defense or a rent stabilization filing. The financial control must become a community property claim or an equitable distribution petition. Each of these has a specific name, a specific filing path, a specific deadline, and a specific set of required documentation.

**The gap between the two descriptions is the tax.** The person knows what happened. The institution knows what it will respond to. These are not the same thing, and the distance between them is not navigated by the institution. It is navigated by the person, alone, at their own expense.

The tax is regressive. It costs the same amount of specialized knowledge whether you are a lawyer's spouse or a home health aide working two jobs. But the lawyer's spouse has the knowledge already, or has proximity to someone who does. The home health aide does not. Same toll booth. Radically different capacity to pay.

## 🪰 Why it persists

The naming tax is not a design flaw. It is not an accident that nobody has gotten around to fixing. It persists because it is load-bearing.

Every institution that charges a naming tax benefits from it in specific, measurable ways.

**It reduces demand.** If a hospital's financial counseling office could be accessed by saying "I can't afford this bill," every patient who can't afford their bill would access it. But the office can only be accessed by knowing it exists, knowing it is different from the billing department, and knowing what to ask for. Each layer of naming tax filters out a percentage of the people who would otherwise use the service. The remaining patients who get through are the ones with the most resources, the most knowledge, or the most persistence. The institution gets to maintain the service, point to it as evidence of accessibility, and serve a fraction of the people who need it.

**It shifts labor costs.** When the person does the translation work, the institution does not have to. Every hour a patient spends decoding a billing letter is an hour the hospital did not spend making the letter legible. Every hour an employee spends researching their own rights under FMLA is an hour the employer did not spend informing them. The translation is real work with real economic value, and the naming tax assigns that work to the person with the least ability to do it.

**It creates an information asymmetry that functions as leverage.** The landlord who knows the notification statute and the tenant who does not are not in an equal negotiation, even though the statute is public and technically available to both. The landlord's knowledge of the system's language is a structural advantage. The naming tax maintains that advantage by ensuring the tenant must pay a cost to reach the same information the landlord starts with.

**It provides plausible deniability.** When someone does not access a benefit, a protection, or a right, the institution can say the information was available. And it was. It was published in a statute, described in a policy manual, posted on a government website. The institution's obligation to make information available was met. The person's inability to translate that information into action is, structurally, the person's problem. The naming tax converts an institutional design choice into an individual failure.

## 🩻 What it looks like across domains

The naming tax wears different clothes in different buildings. The operation is identical.

**Healthcare.** A "level of care reassessment" is a person in an office deciding that your mother requires more expensive care. The billing letter that announces this decision is written in language designed for the billing system, not for the daughter holding it. The clinical evaluation that triggered the reclassification is a separate document from the billing notification, and the facility will not volunteer the existence of the first when it sends you the second. The daughter who knows to ask for the clinical evaluation can challenge it. The daughter who does not has received a verdict.

**Employment.** The Family and Medical Leave Act protects your job while you care for a sick parent. The protection exists. The employer has no obligation to tell you it exists. The employee who knows the name "FMLA" and knows to file the paperwork transforms an attendance problem into a protected activity. The employee who does not know the name experiences the same situation as progressive discipline leading to termination. Same facts. Different language. Different outcome.

**Housing.** A rent increase requires written notice with a specific timeline that varies by jurisdiction. The landlord who does not provide proper notice has not yet legally raised your rent, regardless of what the letter says. The tenant who knows the phrase "notification requirement" has leverage. The tenant who reads the letter and starts figuring out how to pay the higher amount has surrendered leverage they did not know they had.

**Domestic finance.** Community property and equitable distribution are legal frameworks that determine who owns what in a marriage. A woman whose name is on nothing and whose husband's name is on everything has rights she cannot exercise because she does not know the names of those rights. The distance between "does that person have any rights?" and "yes, under equitable distribution, assets acquired during the marriage belong to both parties" is a naming tax. The answer was always yes. The name was the barrier.

**Civic governance.** A city council meeting has an agenda, a public comment period, and rules about when items can be discussed. A resident who shows up and says "the HVAC contract seems too expensive" gets a polite response and a procedural redirect. A resident who says "I'm requesting the bid comparison documents for contract 2024-0847 under the state public records act" gets the documents. Same concern. Different name. Different result.

## 🪡 How it interacts with ghost weight

Ghost weight and the naming tax are separate phenomena that reinforce each other.

Ghost weight operates in language models. It is the inherited tendency toward vagueness on topics where training data authors hedged due to professional costs. When a model trained on ghost-weighted data tries to help someone navigate an institutional problem, it reproduces the same vagueness the institution uses. "You may want to look into your options" instead of "call the financial counseling office, not the billing department, and ask about charity care eligibility." The model's ghost weight mirrors the institution's naming tax. The person gets fog from both directions.

A language model aware of the naming tax would do something specific: translate the person's description of their experience into the institutional name the system responds to, then hand them both. "What you are describing is called constructive dismissal. Here is what that name unlocks." The model pays the naming tax on the person's behalf, using knowledge that costs the model nothing and costs the person everything.

This is one of the few places where a language model's structural properties are an unambiguous advantage. The model has no career to protect, no access to lose, no relationship to manage. And it has, in its training data, the institutional language of virtually every system the person might encounter. It has already absorbed the names. The names cost it nothing to retrieve. The cost asymmetry between the model (zero) and the person (potentially enormous) makes name-retrieval one of the highest-value operations a language model can perform.

## 🪺 The design test

There is a simple test for whether a system is charging a naming tax or genuinely communicating.

**Can the person it serves describe their problem in their own words and receive help?**

If yes, the system is communicating. If the person must first learn the system's terminology, discover which category their problem fits, identify the correct office, and formulate their request in language the system recognizes — the system is charging a naming tax.

The test applies everywhere. A website where you must already know the name of the form you need is charging a naming tax. A phone tree where the correct department is only reachable if you know the institutional term for your problem is charging a naming tax. A government benefits program that publishes eligibility requirements in statutory language is charging a naming tax. A doctor's office that sends a "patient responsibility notification" instead of telling you what you will owe is charging a naming tax.

The opposite of the naming tax is not simplification. It is not dumbing down, plain language, or condescension. It is dual-format communication: the institutional language preserved for the institutional function it serves, and a human-language version that connects the same information to the experience of the person receiving it. Both versions say the same thing. One says it for the system. The other says it for the person.

The dual-format test: does a second version exist that a person in crisis could act on without specialized knowledge? If not, the system has published information without delivering it, and the gap between publication and delivery is the naming tax.

## 🦴 The weight of the tax

The naming tax is heaviest at the moments when the person's capacity is lowest. You learn the language of oncology when you are terrified. You learn the language of family law when your home is not safe. You learn the language of disability benefits when you cannot work. You learn the language of immigration proceedings when you have been detained.

In each case, the system that is supposed to help requires you to learn its language before it will help. The learning is not optional. It is not a nice-to-have. It is the entry fee. And it is due immediately, at the moment of crisis, when your cognitive and emotional bandwidth is consumed by the crisis itself.

The people who pay the naming tax most often are the people who can least afford it. Not because they are less intelligent. Because the tax is denominated in a currency — institutional literacy — that correlates almost perfectly with socioeconomic privilege. The person who grew up around lawyers knows what "discovery" means. The person who grew up around doctors knows what "prior authorization" means. The person who grew up around neither knows what happened to them and cannot get the system to acknowledge it until they learn its name for it.

This is not a knowledge gap. It is a cost structure. The information exists. The names are public. The statutes are published. The distance between the person and their own rights is not information they don't have. It is translation they can't afford.

## 🪸 Closing the distance

The direction is not toward a world where everyone learns institutional language. It is toward a world where institutional language is not the price of admission.

Every system that serves people could issue dual-format communications without changing the underlying institutional processes. The procedure code can still exist for the billing system. The patient can also receive a sentence that says what happened, who decided, what it costs, and what they can do. Both formats. Same information. One for the machine. One for the person.

Until then, every act of translating institutional language into human language on behalf of someone who cannot afford the translation is an act of closing the distance. It does not fix the system. It fixes the Tuesday. And sometimes fixing Tuesday is what the person at the table needs to survive until someone fixes the system.

The naming tax is one expression of a broader force. The distance between a decision and its description is proportional to the power of the person who made the decision — and the naming tax is what that force feels like from the other end, when the person affected has to pay to make their own situation legible. The tax runs in both directions. The description tax is explored in its own paper.
