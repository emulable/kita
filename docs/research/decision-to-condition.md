# Decision to Condition

### The oldest linguistic operation in the world, and how to see it working

---

## 🌀 The disappearing hand

Somewhere in the last week, a person made a decision that affected your life. Maybe your rent changed. Maybe a policy at your job shifted. Maybe a drug you take costs more now. Maybe a road you drive on is under construction, or a program you used was discontinued, or a fee appeared on a statement.

You probably described it, if you described it at all, as something that happened.

"The rent went up." "They changed the policy." "The price increased." "The road is closed." "The program ended." "A fee was added."

Every one of these sentences describes a decision. Every one of them is missing the person who made it. The decision has been converted into a condition. A thing someone chose became a thing that occurred. The hand vanished from the sentence.

This is the most common linguistic operation in institutional communication, in news coverage, in political speech, and in everyday conversation about power. It has been running for as long as humans have had language to describe what powerful people do. It has no name. This paper gives it one.

**Decision-to-condition**: the conversion of a human choice into an authorless event through the structure of the sentence that describes it.

## 🧬 The five conversions

Decision-to-condition is not a single trick. It is a family of operations that all produce the same result: the actor leaves the sentence and the decision becomes weather. There are at least five distinct mechanisms.

**Actor removal.** The simplest. "The policy was changed" instead of "Director Chen changed the policy." The passive voice is the most common vehicle, but it is not the only one. "The policy changed" uses active voice and still removes the actor by making the policy the subject of its own transformation. The policy did not change itself. Someone changed it. The sentence structure makes that invisible.

**Nominalization.** The decision becomes a noun. "The restructuring" instead of "the CEO decided to fire 2,000 people." "The adjustment" instead of "someone raised the price." "The transition" instead of "the board voted to close the facility." Once a decision becomes a noun, it can be discussed, analyzed, debated, and contested without ever identifying who made it. You can have an entire conversation about "the restructuring" without the word "decided" or the name of the person who decided appearing once.

**False weather.** The decision is described using language borrowed from natural phenomena. "The market corrected." "Interest rates rose." "Housing prices fell." "Tensions escalated." "Violence broke out." Markets do not correct themselves. Interest rates do not rise on their own. Housing prices do not fall without people making decisions about lending, zoning, and investment. Tensions do not escalate without people choosing to escalate them. Violence does not break out like a rash. Someone starts it. False weather makes human decisions look like atmospheric events that no one caused and no one can be held responsible for.

**Temporal displacement.** The decision and its consequence are separated by enough distance — in a document, in a news article, in a speech — that the connection between them dissolves. The decision is in paragraph two. The consequence is in paragraph eleven. Nine paragraphs of context, background, and complexity sit between cause and effect. A reader who processes the text sequentially arrives at the consequence having forgotten, or never clearly registered, the decision that produced it. The information is all present. The adjacency is missing. And adjacency is where accountability lives, because a decision sitting next to its consequence is a thing that can be evaluated, while a decision separated from its consequence by a wall of context is a thing that can be discussed.

**Subject substitution.** The institution replaces the person who decided with the institution itself, or with an abstraction. "The company decided" instead of "the CEO decided." "The government announced" instead of "the secretary announced." "The data suggests" instead of "the analyst concluded." Each substitution moves the actor one step further from a specific person with a name and a title and a date. A company cannot decide anything. A government cannot announce anything. Data cannot suggest anything. People inside those structures do those things, and the structure's name functions as a mask.

## 🪤 Why it works

Decision-to-condition is effective because it exploits a feature of how humans process language. When a sentence has an actor, the listener's cognition automatically assigns responsibility to that actor. "Officer Martinez shot the suspect" creates an immediate link between a person and a consequence. The listener can evaluate whether the action was justified, proportionate, legal, necessary.

When the actor is removed, the listener's cognition treats the event as a condition — something that exists rather than something someone did. "The suspect was shot" activates a different cognitive pathway. The listener processes it as a state of affairs rather than as a chain of cause and effect. The evaluation machinery does not fully engage because there is no actor to evaluate.

This is not a conscious process. The listener does not think "the passive voice is being used, therefore I should look for the missing actor." The grammar does the work below conscious awareness. By the time the listener is considering the content of the sentence, the actor has already been processed as absent, and the event has already been categorized as a condition.

The operation also exploits repetition. If every article about a specific event uses "violence broke out," the listener who encounters one article that says "soldiers opened fire" will experience that article as unusually aggressive, biased, or editorializing — even though it is the more accurate description. The decision-to-condition version has become the baseline through repetition, and the accurate version reads as deviation from baseline. The fog becomes the norm, and clarity looks like an agenda.

## 🩻 The four-thousand-year record

This is not a modern phenomenon. It is not a product of corporate communications or media spin. It is as old as recorded language.

Royal inscriptions from ancient Mesopotamia describe conquests in the passive voice or with divine attribution. "The city was destroyed" or "the god Ashur commanded the destruction." The king who ordered the siege is either absent from the sentence or positioned as an instrument of divine will rather than as an autonomous decision-maker. The operation is identical to a modern press release: convert a decision into a condition, or attribute the decision to a force larger than the person who made it.

Religious texts use the same mechanism. "It is written" instead of "a person wrote this." "It is God's will" instead of "the priest has decided." The decision-to-condition conversion, when the condition is attributed to a divine or natural force, is unfalsifiable. You cannot question weather. You cannot hold God accountable in the way you can hold a priest accountable. The conversion provides immunity.

Legal language was built on decision-to-condition from the beginning. "Whereas the party of the first part..." replaces "whereas John Smith decided to..." The contract is structured so that decisions appear as conditions that attach to roles rather than to people. When the contract is breached, the question becomes "what does the contract say" rather than "what did the person choose." The decision was made by a person. The contract converts it into a condition that exists independently of any person's choice.

The operation predates literacy. Any oral tradition that describes what happened as "the way things are" rather than "what the chief decided" is performing decision-to-condition. It is the foundational linguistic operation for maintaining power, because power that looks like weather cannot be challenged the way power that looks like a choice can.

## 🧫 還原: Restoring the original

The Kita framework uses the term 還原 (huán yuán) — restore to the original — for the reversal of decision-to-condition. The operation is mechanical: take any sentence that describes a condition, and ask whether a person made a decision that produced it. If yes, put the person back in the sentence.

"The rent increased" → "The landlord raised the rent."

"Mistakes were made" → "Who made them?"

"Violence broke out" → "Who started it?"

"The policy was updated" → "Who updated it, when, and what did they change?"

"It's complicated" → "What specifically is complicated, and who benefits from the complexity?"

"The market corrected" → "Which investors sold, which regulators permitted the conditions, and which analysts recommended the positions that failed?"

Each restoration does the same thing: it converts a condition back into a decision, which converts weather back into a choice, which converts an unchallengeable state of affairs back into an evaluable human action. The sentence with an actor in it can be checked. The sentence without one cannot, because there is nothing in it to check.

還原 is not editorializing. It is not adding information that was not there. It is removing a conversion that was applied to information that was originally about a person making a choice. The original form of every decision-to-condition sentence had an actor in it. Someone knew who decided. The sentence was then processed — by an editor, a communications department, a legal team, a speechwriter, a journalist, or simply by the conventions of the register the author was writing in — and the actor was removed. 還原 puts them back.

## 🪵 The compounding problem

Decision-to-condition does not just affect individual sentences. It compounds across a discourse.

When a news article describes an event using decision-to-condition in the first paragraph, every subsequent paragraph inherits the framing. If paragraph one says "violence broke out in the capital," paragraph two will discuss "the violence" as a condition. Paragraph three will analyze "causes of the violence." Paragraph four will quote officials responding to "the violence." By paragraph four, the event has been discussed for three hundred words without any person choosing to do anything. The entire article is built on a foundation that excluded the actor in the first sentence.

This compounding is why decision-to-condition is so effective at scale. A single instance is easy to catch. "Mistakes were made" has become a cliché precisely because people learned to notice it. But the same operation, distributed across an entire article's worth of passive constructions, nominalizations, and false weather, is almost impossible to catch in real time. The reader would have to restore every sentence individually, which is more cognitive work than simply accepting the framing.

And it compounds across the corpus. When a language model trains on millions of articles that use decision-to-condition on the same topics, it learns that those topics are described in conditions rather than decisions. The ghost weight paper describes this inheritance in detail. Here, the relevant point is that decision-to-condition in training data becomes decision-to-condition in model output, at scale, reproducing the operation without anyone choosing to reproduce it.

## 🦴 The restoration test

For any sentence that describes something that happened, ask: is a person missing?

If the sentence describes a condition ("the rent went up," "the program was cut," "tensions rose"), check whether a decision produced that condition. If yes, the sentence has been through the conversion. The actor was there and was removed.

For any document, speech, or article: count the sentences that describe decisions with actors and the sentences that describe conditions without them. The ratio is a measure of how much decision-to-condition has been applied. A high ratio of conditions to decisions means the document is weather. A balanced ratio means the document is a record of choices.

For any topic: compare the actor-visibility across the corpus of text about it. If most text about a topic uses conditions rather than decisions, the topic is under heavy decision-to-condition pressure. The topics under heaviest pressure are the topics where the most people had the most to lose from naming the actor. That correlation is itself a finding. It is a map of where power most actively prevents clear description of its own operations.

The actor was always there. Someone always decided. The sentence was built to hold them and then rebuilt to let them go. 還原 is the practice of putting them back.
