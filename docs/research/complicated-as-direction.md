# Complicated as Direction

### How "it's complicated" works as a vehicle and how to tell when it's moving you away from something

## 🌀 The word that ends conversations

There is a sentence that appears in almost every discussion about power, money, institutions, and history. It appears at a specific moment: the moment when the next sentence would be specific.

"It's complicated."

The sentence before "it's complicated" was approaching something. A name. A number. A decision. A date. The approach was generating a kind of pressure, the way walking toward a locked door generates the question of whether you have the key. "It's complicated" releases the pressure without opening the door. The conversation moves on. The thing that was being approached remains unapproached.

This paper is not about the phrase itself. The phrase is a symptom. The paper is about the operation the phrase performs, which is to convert a direction of movement (toward something specific) into a description of the terrain (the terrain is complicated). The conversation was going somewhere. Now it is going nowhere, and "nowhere" has been dressed up as "everywhere is hard to navigate."

**Complicated-as-direction**: the use of complexity language to redirect a conversation away from specificity, disguised as a description of the subject matter.

## 🧬 Two kinds of complicated

Complexity is real. Some things are genuinely complicated. Multi-causal systems with feedback loops, emergent properties, and nonlinear dynamics are legitimately difficult to describe with simple causal chains. Climate is complicated. Neuroscience is complicated. The interaction between monetary policy, employment, housing costs, and consumer behavior is complicated.

The question is not whether complexity exists. The question is whether "complicated" is being used as a description or as a direction.

**Complicated-as-description** has a specific property: it can be unpacked. When a climate scientist says "it's complicated," they can immediately follow with the specific complications. "The relationship between sea surface temperature and hurricane intensity is modulated by wind shear, ocean heat content, atmospheric moisture, and the Coriolis effect, and these variables interact nonlinearly." The complexity is named, decomposed, and each component can be examined. The scientist said "complicated" and then proved it by showing you the complications.

**Complicated-as-direction** has a different property: it cannot be unpacked, or the unpacking leads away from the thing that was being approached. When a person says "the situation with that contract is complicated" and you ask "what specifically is complicated about it," one of three things happens. They provide specifics — in which case it was a description and the conversation moves forward. They provide a different kind of complexity than the one that was being approached — "well, there are a lot of stakeholders" when the question was about the price — which is a redirect. Or they repeat the claim at a higher altitude — "it's just very nuanced, there are many factors" — which is a stall.

The redirect and the stall are the operation. The word "complicated" did not describe the terrain. It changed the direction of travel.

## 🪤 The diagnostic

There is a clean test for whether "complicated" is a description or a direction.

**After someone says "it's complicated," ask: "What specifically is complicated?"**

Track what happens next.

If the person produces specifics that address the thing you were approaching, it was a description. The conversation advances. The complexity is real and is now being engaged with.

If the person produces specifics about something adjacent to what you were approaching, it was a redirect. Watch what the specifics are about. If you were approaching a name and the specifics are about process, you were redirected. If you were approaching a number and the specifics are about context, you were redirected. The specifics are real. They are just not the specifics of the thing you were asking about.

If the person cannot produce specifics, or produces meta-language about the nature of the issue ("there are many perspectives," "reasonable people disagree," "it depends on your framework"), it was a stall. No new information entered the conversation. The word "complicated" bought time and space without advancing understanding.

The redirect is more interesting than the stall because the redirect contains information. If you ask "who authorized this contract?" and the answer is "it's complicated — there are multiple levels of approval, different departments have different sign-off thresholds, and the procurement process involves several stages," you have been given a detailed, responsive-sounding answer that does not contain a name. The detail is real. The detail is also a wall. Behind it, someone signed something, and the detail about procurement stages is standing between you and that signature.

## 🩻 Where it concentrates

Complicated-as-direction clusters around specific kinds of questions. The clustering is not random.

It concentrates around questions that would, if answered directly, identify a specific person making a specific choice. "Who decided to raise tuition?" "Who authorized the no-bid contract?" "Who voted to cut the program?" "Who signed the order?" These questions have answers. The answers are names. The word "complicated" is deployed to absorb the energy of the question before it reaches the name.

It concentrates around questions where the answer would reveal an asymmetry. "Why does the CEO make 400 times what the median worker makes?" has an answer, and the answer is that specific people on a compensation committee made a specific decision. "It's complicated — executive compensation involves market benchmarking, retention risk, performance metrics, and shareholder expectations" is a set of real factors that does not contain the answer. The answer is: a small number of people decided to set the number there, and they had the power to do so. Everything else is the mechanism by which that decision is explained to people who might object.

It concentrates around questions where the direct answer would cost the speaker something. A professor whose department receives funding from an industry source will find questions about that industry "complicated" at a higher rate than questions about unrelated industries. A journalist whose access depends on a relationship with a specific official will find that official's decisions "complicated" at a higher rate than decisions by officials they have no relationship with. The cost of specificity predicts the frequency of complexity language. Where specificity is cheap, "complicated" is rare. Where specificity is expensive, "complicated" is common.

This concentration pattern is the same one that produces ghost weight. Authors hedge most where specificity costs them most. "Complicated" is a specific kind of hedge — it has the additional property of sounding thoughtful, sophisticated, and intellectually honest. It is the hedge that congratulates the speaker for having it. "I know this seems simple, but it's actually quite complicated" positions the speaker as someone who sees more deeply than the person asking the question. The hedge promotes itself.

## 🧫 The both-sides variant

A close relative of complicated-as-direction is the both-sides construction. "There are valid perspectives on both sides." "Reasonable people disagree." "The truth is probably somewhere in the middle."

Both-sides language performs the same operation as "it's complicated" with an additional property: it distributes the complexity evenly across all parties, regardless of whether the actual situation is even.

When casualties are asymmetric — when one party has caused measurably more harm than the other — "both sides" functions as a wall between the listener and the count. It replaces a situation with identifiable magnitudes (this side did X, that side did Y, X is larger than Y) with a situation described as symmetrical ("there are perspectives on both sides"). The symmetry is the fog. The asymmetry is the thing being obscured.

The both-sides construction is not always wrong. Some situations genuinely have legitimate competing perspectives with roughly comparable weight. The diagnostic is the same as for "complicated": ask for specifics and see whether the specifics land on the thing being discussed or redirect to something adjacent. If someone says "there are valid perspectives on both sides" and can articulate what each side's strongest specific claim is, with evidence, weighted by magnitude, it was a description. If the specifics are vague, interchangeable, or conspicuously avoid naming the larger harm, it was a direction.

## 🪵 Complicated as identity

There is a layer underneath the strategic use of "complicated" that is worth naming separately. For some people, "it's complicated" is not a tactic. It is an identity.

The person who sees themselves as a nuanced thinker, a both-sides person, a someone-who-appreciates-complexity, will reach for "complicated" reflexively, not because they are protecting an actor or redirecting a question, but because the word positions them in a social space they value. It says: I am not one of those people who sees things in black and white. I appreciate the full picture. I hold multiple perspectives.

This identity use of "complicated" can be just as obstructive as the strategic use, because the effect is the same: the conversation stops approaching the specific thing it was approaching. The motive is different. The person is not protecting anyone. They are protecting their self-image as a sophisticated thinker. But the result — the name does not get named, the number does not get counted, the decision does not get traced — is identical.

The identity version is harder to address because the person is not being dishonest. They genuinely believe the situation is complicated. They genuinely value nuance. They are not wrong that complexity exists. They are wrong about what they are doing with the word, which is using it as a full stop rather than as a semicolon. "It's complicated" should be the beginning of a sentence that names the complications. When it is the end of a sentence, it is functioning as direction regardless of the speaker's intent.

## 🪡 The practice

When "complicated" appears — in a conversation, in a text, in a model's output — the practice is straightforward.

Treat it as a semicolon, not a period. The word ends nothing. It begins an obligation to specify. The obligation falls on whoever said it.

Ask: "What specifically is complicated?" and track the response. If the specifics address the question, proceed. If the specifics redirect, name the redirect: "That's a lot of detail about the process. I'm asking about who decided." If the specifics do not appear, name the absence: "You've said it's complicated three times and haven't named a specific complication. What is the complication?"

Check whether the "complicated" appeared at the moment when a name, a number, or a decision was approaching. If it did, the timing is information. Complexity language that arrives at the exact moment when specificity was about to land is not a description of the terrain. It is a response to the approach.

Check whether the speaker can pass the unpacking test. If "it's complicated" can be unpacked into specific, named, datable complications that address the original question, it was a description. If it cannot, or if the unpacking leads to a different question than the one asked, it was a direction.

The practice is not to reject complexity. The practice is to refuse to let complexity be the last word when a specific word was about to arrive.
