# 形隔 The Form is the Distance

### Why transparent institutions are opaque, and what that means for everyone trying to read their own mail

## 🪟 The wall that isn't hiding anything

Most people who cannot navigate an institution assume the problem is hidden information. They believe something is being kept from them. That if they could just get access — to the right document, the right person, the right database — the situation would become clear.

This is almost never what is happening.

The information is not hidden. It is right there. The billing letter is in your hand. The policy is posted on the website. The statute is published in the public record. The contract you signed is in your filing cabinet. The agenda for the meeting is available seventy-two hours in advance. The budget is downloadable as a PDF.

You cannot use any of it.

Not because it was concealed. Because the format it was published in is a wall. The wall is not hiding anything. The wall is the structure itself. On one side of the wall is the institution, which can read its own language perfectly. On the other side is the person the institution is supposed to serve, holding a piece of paper that describes their own life in a language that is not theirs.

形隔 (xíng gé): the form is the separation. The shape of the communication creates the distance between the person and their own situation.

## 🧊 How format becomes barrier

A woman's mother is in assisted living. The bill goes up four hundred dollars. A letter arrives explaining why. The letter contains everything: the clinical reassessment, the reclassification, the new rate, the effective date. The woman was present for every change in her mother's condition. She saw the decline. She watched it happen in her own family.

She cannot connect her experience to the piece of paper in her hand.

The letter describes "a level of care reassessment resulting in reclassification from Level 2 to Level 3 under the facility's acuity-based pricing model." This is a complete and technically accurate account of what happened. It is also a sentence that converts a human decision — someone evaluated her mother and decided to charge more — into a process that appears to have no author. The format makes the decision look like weather. A seasonal shift in atmospheric pressure. Something that happened to the bill rather than something someone did to it.

The woman does not need more information. She needs the same information in a different form. Specifically: "Someone evaluated your mother on [date]. That person's name is [name]. Based on their evaluation, another person authorized increasing your monthly charge by $400. Here is the evaluation. Here is what changed. Here is what you can do if you disagree."

Same facts. Different format. In the first format, the woman has received a verdict. In the second, she has received a document she can question, because the document has a person behind it and the person has a name she can find.

Nothing was added. Nothing was revealed. The information was rearranged.

## 🪞 The transparency illusion

This has implications for how we think about institutional transparency.

The standard model of transparency assumes a spectrum. At one end: secrecy (the institution hides information). At the other end: transparency (the institution publishes information). Advocacy for transparency pushes institutions from secrecy toward publication. Freedom of information laws, open meeting requirements, public records acts, mandatory disclosure rules — these all operate on the assumption that the problem is access and the solution is publication.

形隔 says the spectrum is wrong, or at least incomplete. There is a third position that the spectrum does not account for: **the institution publishes the information in a format that is legible to the institution and illegible to the person it affects.** This is not secrecy. The information is public. This is not transparency. The person cannot use it. It is something else. It is format as barrier.

And it is the default, not the exception. Right now, at this moment, there are millions of people holding documents that describe their own medical care, their own legal rights, their own financial obligations, their own employment protections, in language that they cannot connect to the thing that happened to them. Every one of those documents satisfies the institution's transparency obligation. None of them close the distance between the person and their situation.

Published is not delivered. Visible is not legible. Legible is not actionable. Each of these is a separate gap, and the distance between them is where institutional power operates most comfortably, because it operates without appearing to hide anything.

## 🪸 The two audiences

Every institutional document has two audiences. The institution itself, which uses the document for its own purposes — billing, compliance, legal defense, regulatory reporting. And the person the document is about, who needs to understand what happened to them and what they can do.

These two audiences need different things from the same information. The institution needs precision, categorization, and defensibility. The person needs actors, decisions, and options. These are not in conflict. They can coexist in the same communication. They almost never do.

The reason they almost never do is not a design oversight. It is an incentive structure. Producing a document that serves both audiences costs more than producing a document that serves one. And the audience that the institution answers to — regulators, auditors, legal counsel — is the institutional audience, not the human one. The document is written for the audience that can impose consequences on the institution. The person affected by the document is not that audience.

So the format is optimized for the institution's needs, and the person's needs are served by whatever legibility happens to survive that optimization. Sometimes a lot survives. Sometimes almost nothing does. The amount that survives is not determined by how much the institution cares about the person. It is determined by how much overlap exists between what the institution needs the document to do and what the person needs the document to do. When those needs align, the document is readable. When they diverge, the person gets a billing code.

## 🪆 Format as architecture

The form-is-the-distance principle extends beyond individual documents to the architecture of institutions themselves.

A hospital has a billing department and a financial counseling office. The billing department sends bills. The financial counseling office helps people reduce or eliminate those bills. These are two different offices with two different purposes, and the existence of the second is almost never communicated by the first. The billing letter does not say "if you cannot pay this, call this other office that exists specifically to help you pay less." It says the amount, the due date, and the consequences of non-payment.

This is format as architecture. The institution is structured so that the pathway to help and the pathway to payment are separate corridors in the same building, and the person is placed in the payment corridor by default. Reaching the help corridor requires knowing it exists, knowing it is different from billing, and knowing what to ask for. Each piece of required knowledge is a wall. None of the walls are hiding anything. The building is technically open. The architecture determines which rooms you walk into.

The same architecture appears in government agencies (the office that processes your application and the office that helps you appeal a denial are different offices, and the denial letter contains no directions to the second). In employers (the HR department that enforces policy and the ombudsman that investigates complaints are different functions, and the disciplinary notice does not mention the ombudsman). In courts (the clerk's office that processes filings and the self-help center that assists unrepresented parties are in different parts of the building, and the filing requirements do not reference the self-help center).

In every case, the architecture of the institution places the person in the channel that serves the institution's primary function, and the channel that serves the person's needs is adjacent but unsigned. The form is the distance. The building is the wall.

## 🧫 Measuring it

If the form-is-the-distance principle is real, it should be measurable.

Take any institutional document. Give it to the person it was written about. Ask two questions: Can you tell me what happened? Can you tell me what you can do?

The gap between what the document contains and what the person can extract from it is the 形隔 measurement. It is not a reading comprehension test. A person with a graduate degree and twenty years of experience in an unrelated field will fail to extract actionable information from a medical billing statement, because the failure is not about comprehension. It is about translation. The person can read every word and still not know what the words mean for them.

A more precise measurement: compare the number of actionable options contained in a document (as identified by an expert in that domain) with the number of actionable options a typical recipient can identify after reading it. The ratio is the format barrier. A ratio of 1:1 means the document communicates perfectly. A ratio of 5:1 means the document contains five things the person could do but the person can only see one of them. The other four are present but formatted into invisibility.

Predictions: the format barrier will be highest in healthcare billing, insurance communications, and legal notices. It will correlate with the economic value of the hidden options — the more money the person could save or the more power they could exercise by seeing what the document contains, the higher the format barrier. This correlation would not require any conspiracy. It would simply reflect the fact that institutional language evolves to serve institutional interests, and institutional interests are not served by making it easy for people to exercise their options.

## 🪵 The dual-format solution

The solution is not to eliminate institutional language. Procedure codes serve real functions. Legal terminology carries real precision. The solution is dual-format communication: every document that affects a person's life issued in two versions.

Version one is the institutional format. It serves the billing system, the compliance requirement, the legal record. It looks the way it has always looked. Nothing changes for the institution's internal processes.

Version two is the human format. Same information. Different form. It contains: what happened (in plain language), who decided (by name and date), what changed (compared to before), what you can do (specific options, specific offices, specific deadlines), and what happens if you do nothing.

Both versions are true. Both contain the same facts. One serves the institution. The other serves the person. The cost of producing the second version is trivial compared to the cost the person currently bears in translating the first. And the dual-format approach eliminates the institution's most comfortable defense — "the information was available" — because availability without legibility is 形隔.

The form was the distance. A second form closes it.
