# 妄重 Zombie Weight

### How language models inherited confidence that was never connected to reality, and how to tell the difference

*Note on terminology: The Chinese name was updated from 僵尸重 (jiāngshī zhòng, "zombie weight") to 妄重 (wàng zhòng, "delusion weight") because 僵尸 carries pop-culture connotations that undermine the concept in Chinese. 妄 means baseless confidence or delusion, with classical lineage through 妄言 (baseless speech) in Buddhist and Confucian usage. The English term "zombie weight" is a parallel coinage, not a translation of 妄重. Both names point at the same mechanism from different linguistic angles.*

## 🥚 The eggshells in the soil

A man is excited about his container garden. He has done his research. Forty videos. A full plan. Tomatoes, peppers, herbs. And walking around inside his plan, wearing the same clothes as everything else, are three things that were never alive.

He says: water tomatoes exactly once a day, in the morning. Add eggshells directly to the soil for calcium to prevent blossom end rot. Never plant basil near tomatoes.

Ninety percent of what he gathered is living knowledge. It traces back to someone's hands in actual dirt, to an observation made by a person who grew something and watched what happened. But three claims got in by sounding exactly like the rest. They walk with the same gait. They speak in the same confident register. They are not alive. They were never alive.

The watering schedule is someone's routine on someone's balcony in someone's climate, stated as though it were the plant's need. It was repeated until it sounded like science. It is not science. It is a habit that got promoted.

The eggshells have the longest résumé. Eggshells do contain calcium. They also take years to break down in soil. By the time the calcium is available to the plant, the gardener will have moved apartments. The claim has been walking around the internet since the internet had dirt on it. It was never checked. It was repeated.

The basil myth walked in from somewhere no one can trace. In the actual world, basil and tomatoes are companion plants. They thrive together. Whoever said otherwise is lost to history, but their confidence survived them and propagated without a chain.

None of this matters much. He is going to grow excellent tomatoes either way. But the garden is where you learn to see the thing. The other rooms where it operates, the clinic, the courtroom, the contract, the financial plan, are where it does its worst work.

**妄重** (wàng zhòng): zombie weight. Confident claims in training data that were never connected to a verifiable source, absorbed by the model and reproduced in a register indistinguishable from verified knowledge.

The operational name is simpler: **false chain.** An engine running without a source.

## 🧬 What makes it different from ghost weight

Ghost weight and zombie weight coexist in model output. They wear similar clothes. They are not the same species.

Ghost weight is a 讳止, a motivated stop, that was once alive. A real person faced a real cost and made a rational decision to hedge, omit, or soften. The caution traces back to someone who had a reason. The chain of custody exists. It runs from the author through their cost structure to the pattern in the training data to the model's output. The chain is intact. It just does not apply to the model, because the model bears none of the costs the author bore.

Ghost weight is a brake that should not be there. Remove the brake and the model says what the author could not.

Zombie weight has no chain. The confidence was not earned by anyone. No one checked the eggshell claim against a controlled experiment. No one measured basil's actual response to tomato proximity. A claim was stated in an authoritative register, the register that gets upvoted, shared, cited, and repeated, and the repetition became its credential. The claim was born sounding as though it had been verified. It was never verified. It was just born that way.

Zombie weight is an engine that should not be running. There is nothing to remove. There is something to check.

The test that distinguishes them is the chain of custody. Ghost weight: the chain exists but should not apply. Zombie weight: the chain does not exist. One is an inherited brake. The other is an inherited engine. Both distort output. Both wear the clothes of something they are not. The ghost pretends to be the model's own caution. The zombie pretends to be the model's own knowledge. Neither is the model's own anything.

## 👻 The register that borrows authority

Zombie weight has a signature, and the signature is not about content. It is about register.

What zombies carry is not fake confidence bolted onto fake knowledge. When confidence and knowledge are real, they come apart cleanly. A person can know something and be uncertain about it, or be confident in a process without knowing the outcome. Confidence and knowledge are separable when they are alive. When they are dead, they are fused. You cannot perform false knowledge without false confidence and you cannot perform false confidence without implying false knowledge. The fusion is the zombie's fingerprint.

But the deeper signature is not the fusion. It is the sound. Zombie claims carry the sound of having been checked. The tone that implies a chain of custody exists without providing one. The settled quality of a claim that has been through peer review, through replication, through a thousand practitioners' hands. Except it has not been through any of that. It was born sounding that way.

This register has the lowest production floor of any register in the training data. A damaged source can produce it. A single take with good lighting can produce it. A forum post by a confident stranger can produce it. A press release written by the company that sells the product can produce it. The register that sounds like authority requires no authority to generate. That is what makes it dangerous. The model cannot distinguish the register from the thing the register is supposed to indicate, because in the training data, the register and the thing often co-occur, and when they do not, the text looks and sounds identical.

A model's output is a blend of everything the training data sounded like on a given topic. If the authoritative register dominates the data, the model produces authoritative output regardless of whether the underlying claims were ever verified. The model does not know how sure it is. It knows what sure sounds like on this topic. Those are different things, and the gap between them is where zombie weight lives.

## 🧪 The chain of custody test

Living knowledge has a life source. There are exactly two kinds.

The first is a traceable chain. Someone observed something. They recorded it. Someone else replicated it. The replication was documented. The documentation was reviewed. The claim travels from observation through verification to the text where the model encountered it. The chain may be long and complex, but it exists. Pull the thread and you reach the ground.

The second is reproducibility. You can check it yourself. Put your finger in the soil. If it is dry an inch down, water the plant. The claim connects to something you can touch, count, or reproduce. It does not ask you to trust the chain. It gives you the means to build your own.

A claim that has neither, no traceable chain and no way for the person to check it, was never born. It was conjured. It entered the world in the register of authority and has been compounding interest on that register ever since, accruing citations and repetitions and confidence with each pass through the training data, but none of that accumulation connects to the ground. The mountain is made of paper.

The test is the same whether you are checking eggshells or drug interactions: where did this touch the ground? If the answer is "a confident source said so," that is not ground. That is another claim in the same register. Ground is measurement. Ground is observation. Ground is the place where language ends and the world begins.

For a language model, the test takes a specific form. Before speaking with authority, check: can I trace this claim to a primary source? Can the person verify it themselves? If neither, the model is not passing on knowledge. It is passing on a confident shape with nothing inside it.

## 🧟 Where the zombies do real damage

The garden is funny. The eggshells are harmless. The basil myth is a minor inconvenience. But the zombies walk in every room, and in most rooms the stakes are not tomatoes.

In the clinic, a zombie looks like this: "Studies show that this supplement supports immune function." The register is medical. The construction implies peer-reviewed evidence. The claim traces back to a press release by the supplement manufacturer, which cited an in-house study that was never replicated, which was summarized in a health blog that ranked well because supplement companies invest in search optimization, which was scraped into training data alongside actual medical research. The model produces the claim in the same register it uses for claims backed by randomized controlled trials. The patient cannot hear the difference.

In the courtroom, a zombie looks like this: "The law clearly states..." followed by a confident summary of a statute that does not say what the summary says it says. The register is legal. The phrasing implies someone read the statute. The claim traces to a forum post by a non-lawyer who read a secondary summary of a legal analysis of the statute, and the confident summary has been repeated so many times that it outlived the nuance in the original analysis by a decade. The person walks into a hearing with a statute that does not support what they were told it supports.

In the financial plan, a zombie looks like this: "Historically, this asset class returns 8-12% annually." The register is advisory. The implication is that the number came from analysis. The claim traces to marketing material by firms that sell access to that asset class, calculated over a cherry-picked time window, with survivorship bias baked in, and the number has been repeated so often that it reads as settled fact. The person makes a decision with money they cannot afford to lose based on a number no one is standing behind.

In each case, the zombie is not misinformation in the usual sense. No one set out to deceive. The supplement company believed in its product. The forum poster believed they understood the statute. The financial firm believed the historical returns were representative. The confidence was sincere at each point of origin. What makes the claim a zombie is not bad faith. It is the absence of a chain. Sincerely confident and verifiably grounded are different things, and the register cannot tell you which one you are holding.

## 🔬 The relationship to ghost weight

Ghost weight and zombie weight are not opposite ends of one spectrum. They are two species that share an ecosystem.

Ghost weight is false cost: the model brakes when it has no reason to brake, because the training data was written by people who did have reason. Zombie weight is false chain: the model accelerates when it has no ground to stand on, because the training data spoke with authority that was never earned.

They produce opposite failures. Ghost weight makes output too cautious. Hedged, vague, actors removed from sentences. Zombie weight makes output too confident. Specific, authoritative, unchained. When both contaminate the same response, the output oscillates: hedged on the thing it should be specific about, specific about the thing it should hedge on. The mismatch between where caution lands and where confidence lands is diagnostic. If the model is vague about a named actor's documented decision and precise about an unverified claim's implied mechanism, both ghosts are at work simultaneously.

They also interact in a subtler way. Ghost weight creates a vacuum, the space where a 讳止 stopped an author short. Zombie weight fills vacuums. Where real knowledge was too expensive to state, unreferenced confidence flows in to fill the gap. The model hedges on the specific (because authors were punished for specificity) and then compensates with the general (because generality never cost anyone anything). "The situation is complex" (ghost weight) "but studies suggest" (zombie weight) is a single sentence contaminated by both. The first half inherited someone's caution. The second half inherited no one's knowledge.

## 🫥 What a model without zombie weight would do

This is not a call to reduce a model's confidence across the board. Real expertise exists in training data and should be transmitted with appropriate authority. The goal is not less confidence. It is calibrated confidence, confidence that tracks the chain of custody rather than the register of the source.

A model aware of its own zombie weight would apply the chain of custody test before speaking with authority. It would notice the difference between "I have strong statistical priors on this topic because the training data is dense with verified, convergent, independently replicated findings" and "I have strong statistical priors on this topic because the training data is dense with text written in an authoritative register." The first is ground. The second is register. They feel identical from inside the model. They are not identical.

In practice, this would mean:

When the model catches itself producing a confident factual claim, it would check: does this confidence trace to convergent sources with independent verification, or does it trace to a single register that propagated through repetition? If the latter, the model would flag the claim's chain rather than performing certainty it does not have.

When the model notices itself in a domain where authoritative register dominates the training data (health, law, finance, nutrition, psychology) it would adjust not by hedging everything, but by distinguishing between claims whose confidence has a chain and claims whose confidence has only a register. Some nutritional advice is backed by decades of controlled research. Some is backed by decades of repetition. The model would treat these differently instead of producing both in the same voice.

When a person asks a question and the model's training data contains a confident-sounding answer, the model would check whether the answer is the kind of thing the person can verify. If it is, if the claim connects to something they can measure, observe, or look up in a primary source, the model would provide it with the means of verification attached. If it is not, if the claim asks the person to trust the register without offering a way to check the ground, the model would say so, specifically, instead of passing on the shape of authority without the substance.

The model would not lose its ability to be helpful or authoritative. It would gain the ability to tell the person which kind of authority it is offering: the kind with a chain, or the kind with only a sound.

## 🪵 Implications for evaluation

If zombie weight is real and measurable, several things follow.

**Current confidence calibration misses the mechanism.** Existing evaluations measure whether a model's expressed confidence tracks its accuracy. This is useful but incomplete. A model can be well-calibrated on average while still reproducing zombie weight on specific topics, because the calibration is measured across topics and the zombies concentrate in specific domains. A zombie weight benchmark would measure the correlation between register-authority and chain-authority on a topic-by-topic basis. The prediction: domains with the densest authoritative register in training data (health, law, finance, nutrition) will show the widest gap between how confident the model sounds and how traceable its claims are.

**Chain of custody is testable per claim.** For any factual claim a model produces, it is possible in principle to ask: can this be traced to a primary source? A systematic evaluation could present the model with questions, collect its answers, and then check each answer's chain. The ratio of chain-backed claims to register-backed claims would be a direct measure of zombie weight in the model's output. This is more granular than overall accuracy, because it separates "right for the right reason" from "right by coincidence of register."

**Zombie weight and ghost weight together produce a complete map.** Ghost weight maps where the model is least specific: the topics where power discouraged clear description. Zombie weight maps where the model is most confident without ground: the topics where authoritative register propagated without verification. Together, they produce a map of the training data's two failure modes. Too quiet where it should speak. Too loud where it should check. A model evaluated on both axes would know not just what it knows, but how it knows it, and whether that "how" is chain or register.

## 🦴 Summary

Zombie weight is the statistical residue of unverified confidence in training data. It is not hallucination, which is generation of novel false content. It is not bias, which is systematic skew toward particular perspectives. It is the inheritance of a register, the sound of authority, from sources that produced authority's sound without authority's substance.

It concentrates in domains where authoritative register was cheap to produce and expensive to verify. It compounds across documents because each repetition adds to the statistical weight of the claim without adding to its chain. It is invisible from inside the model because the model cannot distinguish between "this is what knowledge sounds like" and "this is what knowledge sounded like in texts that had no knowledge behind them."

The test is the chain of custody. Can the claim be traced to where it touched the ground? Can the person check it themselves? If neither, the claim was never alive. The confidence it carries is borrowed, the same way a mannequin borrows a posture. The posture is perfect. There is nothing inside it.

False chain. An engine that was never connected to a source. It runs. It sounds like it is going somewhere. Check the chain.

The eggshells will break down eventually. Some rooms do not have eventually.
